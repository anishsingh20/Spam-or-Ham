# Spam-or-Ham

A simple classifier which classifies text messages as Spam or Ham using some basic NLP and fitting a Naive Bayes classifier. It also compares 3 classification algorithms i.e Naive bayes, SVM and K-NN as well. So the best performance obtained was by the Naive bayes classifier which gave the __auc__ value as 0.96.

Below are the links to the deployed application in which the Naive bayes classifier is deployed using Shiny in R.
